# Getting Started:

In order to run locally:


- [Node.js](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/installation-of-node-js-on-windows/) needs to be installed on your OS
- Clone the `webhook-sms-email` [repo](https://github.com/Tidelaw/webhook-sms-email.git)
- Start the project
    1. Run `npm install` to install all our project dependencies
    2. Run `npm run dev` to run our application


`npm install` downloads the packages found in `package.json`

`npm run dev` runs the website. The website can now be accessed from `localhost:3000` or `0.0.0.0`

In order for the app to run, a **Helius Webhook** is necessary - in order to obtain one, visit
